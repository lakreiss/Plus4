Add on to the game gives each player 2 special pieces (lower case x and o) that, if victory is achieved
with the special piece, the winning team gets two points instead of one. If a tie occurs, but one player
gets their 4-in-a-row with their special piece, they get two points while their opponent gets one.

Game to 10.
